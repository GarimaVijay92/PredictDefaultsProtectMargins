# PredictDefaultsProtectMargins
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the Probability of Default (PD) for small business loans using historical data from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The initiative supports regulatory compliance under the Basel Framework &amp; aids banks in optimizing loan approvals for profitability &amp; financial stability.
